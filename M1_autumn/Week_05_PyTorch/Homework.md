# Homework

## 1st homework
- due to **Nov. 11, 2020**
- train your model with [face_dataset3]() and evaluate your model with the test dataset in face_dataset1.
- you can use `01_classification.ipynb`, and write down the accuracy and, if you can, you also can figure out why the accuracy was low/high.

## 2nd homework
- due to **Nov. 18, 2020**

The main task is to conduct the classification of footwear including sandals, sneakers, and ankle boots with [fashion_dataset2](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YmKP_K9b9ZsZNWonA0t9FuDp6OSH16yW?usp=sharing).
*Dataset* function should be changed to obtain only classes regarding footwear.
And also I would like to know the performance of [Residual Block](https://towardsdatascience.com/residual-network-implementing-resnet-a7da63c7b278), so compare the results of the following models: (1) CNN model which is used in the first lecture (you can modify if you want). (2) The model which has Residual Block prior to the convolutional block of the 1st model.

- In short, your works will be:
  - make *Dataset* function.
  - implement Residual Block and merge it into the model we've built.
  - compare the performances of 2 models.
