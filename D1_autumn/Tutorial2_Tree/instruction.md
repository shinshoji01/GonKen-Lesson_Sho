# Tutorial: Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classification
For today's tutorial, I will mainly use jupyter notebook (or JupyterLab).
So, you can write and run the code to better understand the content.
There are two notebooks in this folder:
- `demo.ipynb`: A notebook with full codes (if you can understand all the content, I think you do not need to attend this tutorial)
- `demo_blank.ipynb`: You can use this notebook to write and run codes with me.

The following is the list of the version of packages (just in case you encounter errors related to the version):
- jupyterlab: 1.2.6
- matplotlib: 3.6.1
- numpy: 1.23.4
- pandas: 1.5.0
- scikit-learn: 1.1.2
